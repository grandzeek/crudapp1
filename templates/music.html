<h1 style="color: green;font-size: 40px"><b><u><img src="images/storm.jpg" alt="croog"style="float: left"width="40"height="40">Spotify</u></b></h1>
<p style="color: #000000;text-align: justify">Spotify is a proprietary <mark>Swedish</mark> audio streaming and media services provider founded on 23 April 2006 by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. It is one of the largest music streaming service providers, with over 489 million monthly active users, including 205 million paying subscribers, as of December 2022.</p>

<h1 STYLE="color: #591414;text-align: -webkit-left;font-size: 20px">Best App</h1>
<p style="color: #000000;text-align: justify">This app is by far the <u style="color: green">best music service I’ve ever used</u>. (Music platforms I’ve used premium for: SoundCloud, Apple Music) Out of all of the platforms I’ve used, this one trumps all of them by having the greatest variety of songs. Literally all of my music is on here, including covers, nightcore, pop, rock, indie, alternative, rap, and foreign genres like kpop and jpop. It also has the lyrics automatically displayed and as someone who likes to sing and sometimes read for better lyrics comprehension, this is a great feature to have! Of course I have premium but I’ve used the free version for a considerable amount of time, and I can say that it’s definitely worth it to get premium for no ads, unlimited skips, and infinite playlist customization. I love listening to playlists I’ve created on this app! I have over 20 of them so far. This feature is awesome; you can share playlists with friends (and even collaborate with them on playlists too!), put a custom cover image, add a description, and add whatever songs you want. I like this feature because then I don’t have to manually change songs every time one ends. The fact that you can download songs is great too, and this app works on very low bandwidth so if you’re on a plane that offers wifi you can listen without having to worry. Overall I’d say if you’re considering going premium, this app is a must have! But if you want the free version, just know you’ll have limited control over what you play and when you play it.</p>
